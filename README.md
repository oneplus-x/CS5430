This was a semester long project for CS5430 at Cornell University during the Spring 2015 semester. This project was worked on in a group of four, Marcos, Megan, John, and Dan. The goal was to build a secure password manager, the only restrictions was that it had to use Java, and have a server and client application. 

If you want to run this project, there is a more detailed readme in the Jammed directory, download, compile and run to see how it works. This particular repository is a duplicate of my (Marcos) private fork of the project that I worked on for the duration of the semester. I personally wrote the DB class, and the GuiJammed, LoginGUI, and MainGUI classes with some help from Megan. The course staff has given permission for us to make our project public now that the course ended on 5/6/15. 

This was my favorite course at Cornell and I feel as though I have learned more by working on this project than all my other CS courses at Cornell combined.

Major shortcomings: 
- No integrity gaurantees aside from SSL, and host name checking was not implemented on SSL
- When running on a new machine, you have to manually create a directory "keys/" in the bin folder, that is where the code looks to place the keys by default, but it does not create the directory if it doesn't exist. 
- Similarly, typing a directory that doesn't exist in the command line gui will also cause issues.
